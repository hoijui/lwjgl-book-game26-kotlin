# LWJGL-Book - Chapter 26 - in Kotlin

This is simply a Kotlin port of the Java project
acompanying [chapter 26 of @ahbejarano's git-book about LWJGL game development](
https://ahbejarano.gitbook.io/lwjglgamedev/chapter26).

I chose Chapter 26, as it contains all the previous chapters code,
and the following few chapters start a new project from scratch,
so this contians the most aspects.

The Java project this repo is a port of can be found [here](
https://github.com/lwjglgamedev/lwjglbook/tree/master/chapter26).

The source repo of the (Java based) tutorial git-book can be found [here](
https://github.com/lwjglgamedev/lwjglbook-bookcontents).
